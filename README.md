#Weight Prediction with Linear Regression

#Overview

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict a person's weight based on their height. The dataset consists of height and weight measurements, and the model is trained to find the best fit line for prediction.

#Requirements

To run this project, you need basic knowledge of machine learning and Python. The necessary libraries include Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Joblib.

#Steps

Load the dataset containing height and weight measurements.

Visualize the relationship between height and weight using scatter plots.

Train a linear regression model to establish a predictive relationship.

Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Visualize the best-fit line to understand the prediction results.

Save the trained model for future use and reload it when needed.

#Results

The model successfully predicts weight based on height with a reasonable accuracy. The evaluation metrics, such as MSE and MAE, help in understanding the model's performance. The best-fit line visually represents the relationship between height and weight.
